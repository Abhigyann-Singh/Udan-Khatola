Nalin, Aman and Abhigyan
[] - Add Kalman Filter
[] - Use Cascading PID
[] - Use gyroscope readings to get angle

Kshitij and Ponnathavan
[] - Use 2 servo motors instead of 1 for ailerons
[] - PID tuning (research on how to do)
[] - Aerodynamics stuff (primarily research)

Pradhyuman and Sarthak
[] - Use RF receiver to control
[] - Add throttle control functionality with RF receiver

Aman and Arjun:
[] - maintain 50Hz freq (add suitable delays)
[] - Implement yaw control

Notes:
- RF Transmitter will send angle, not rate.
- Use kalman filter for all 3 axes, but single loop PID for yaw and cascading PID for roll and pitch
