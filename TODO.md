Nalin, Aman and Abhigyan:  
[ ] - Add Kalman Filter  
[ ] - Use Cascading PID  
[ ] - Use gyroscope readings to get angle  

Kshitij and Ponnathavan:  
[ ] - Use 2 servo motors instead of 1 for ailerons  
[ ] - PID tuning (research on how to do)  
[ ] - Aerodynamics stuff (primarily research)  

Pradhyuman and Sarthak:  
[ ] - Use RF receiver to control  
[ ] - Add throttle control functionality with RF receiver  

Aman and Arjun:  
[ ] - maintain 50Hz freq (add suitable delays)  
[ ] - Implement yaw control  

Nalin:  
[ ] - Update README  
      - Add Sarthak and Pradhyuman in contributors list  
      - Replace library doc images with text  
      - Complete the description after project completion.

Notes:  
- RF Transmitter will send angle, not rate.  
- Use kalman filter for all 3 axes
- Single loop PID for yaw and Cascading PID for roll and pitch
